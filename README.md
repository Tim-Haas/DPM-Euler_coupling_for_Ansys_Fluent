# DPM-Euler coupling for Ansys Fluent

Lagrange Particle Tracking (LPT) is commonly implemented with the particle source in a cell method by Clift et al. This method was originally developed for sprays, thus, is based on the assumption that the particle is small compared to the Eulerian grid. This assumption is violated for larger particles like bubbles, especially on fine Eulerian grids such as those for LES simulations.

In those situations, momentum coupling with a single cell causes unphysical results like pseudo-turbulence (particle velocity fluctuations then the particle crosses a cell face) and an overestimate of both, the fluid and particle velocity (see Fig 1-2). Finally, it causes divergence. 

This UDF assembly for unstructured hexahedral grid in Ansys Fluent makes LPT fully independent of the Eulerian grid. Cells within the particleâ€˜s influencing sphere are identified by an face loop cascade. The Eulerian fluid properties are mapped to the Lagrange particle by the Deen mapping polynom and the particle's momentum is distributed back by the same approach. Different drag and lift closures can be chosen.
